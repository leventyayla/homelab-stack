## PR #27 Review — Base Infrastructure (AlexChen31337)

**Overall: Good quality with real content, but several issues must be fixed before merge.**

---

### Strengths

- Traefik static config is complete; TLS 1.2/1.3 cipher suites configured correctly
- Security headers middleware is comprehensive (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Dashboard protected with Basic Auth; insecure mode disabled
- `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.htpasswd` and certificate files
- HTTP -> HTTPS auto-redirect configured correctly

---

### Must Fix

**1. Missing `stacks/base/docker-compose.yml`**

This PR only submits Traefik config files. Issue #1 requires a complete Traefik + Portainer + Watchtower compose file — this is the core deliverable. Portainer and Watchtower services are entirely absent.

**2. `accessLog` path has no volume mount**

`traefik.yml` configures:
```yaml
accessLog:
  filePath: /var/log/traefik/access.log
```
But there is no corresponding volume mount, so logs are lost on container restart.

**3. Let's Encrypt ACME config is incomplete**

The `certResolver` section in `traefik.yml` is truncated — missing the `acme` block (email, storage path, challenge type).

**4. No test results provided**

Missing `docker compose ps` output screenshot and curl verification of Traefik dashboard accessibility.

**5. No model usage proof**

Issue requires proof of claude-opus-4-6 usage (conversation screenshot) and a GPT-5.3 Codex review report. Neither is included in the PR description.

### Suggestions

- The `secured` chain middleware directly references `authentik`, but Base Stack should not depend on SSO Stack. Make it optional or add a comment.
- Add healthcheck definitions for all services.

---

**Verdict: Please add `stacks/base/docker-compose.yml`, complete ACME config, and provide test evidence before this can be merged.**
